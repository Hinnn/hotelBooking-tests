# Assignment 1 - API testing and Source Control.

Name: Yue Wang

## Overview.

Based on the web app development assignment, I added these test code to make sure that there is no mistake. It contains three test files: bookings-test, rooms-test and customers-test. I have connected it with mLab and also I use before and after functions to make sure the datas sotred in the database keep the data unchanged no matter what we do in each describe function.

## API endpoints.

 + GET /bookings - Get all bookings.
 + GET /bookings/:customerID - Get a booking with the specific customerID.
 + POST /bookings/:customerID - Add a booking with specific customerID.
 + PUT /bookings/:customerID/amount - Edit the amount of the customer's booking.
 + DELETE /bookings/:customerID - Delete a booking by customerID.
 + GET /bookings/:amount - Get total amount of bookings.
 + GET /rooms - Get all rooms.
 + GET /rooms/:roomNum - Get a room with the specific roomNum.
 + POST /rooms - Add a room.
 + PUT /rooms/:roomNum/price - Edit the price of the room.
 + DELETE /rooms/:roomNumID - Delete a room by roomNum.
 + POST /customers - Customer sign up.
 + POST /customers/:email - Customer log in.
 + GET /customers - Get all customers.
 + GET /customers/:customerID - Get a customer with the specific customerID.
 + DELETE /customers/:customerID - Delete a customer by customerID.

## Data storage.
I have connected it with mLab. There are three collections named bookingsdb, roomsdb and customersdb and also three schemas named bookings,customers and rooms.

    let BookingSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    customerID: Number,
    paymenttype: String,
    date: Number,
    amount: Number,
    roomNum: String,
    price: Number
    },
    { collection: 'bookingsdb' });
    module.exports = mongoose.model('Booking', BookingSchema);

    let RoomSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    roomNum: String,
    price: Number,
    type : String
    },
    { collection: 'roomsdb' });
    module.exports = mongoose.model('Room', RoomSchema);

    let CustomerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    customerID: Number,
    name: String,
    email : String,
    password: String
    },
    { collection: 'customersdb' });
    module.exports = mongoose.model('Customer', CustomerSchema);

## Extra features.
  At first, I forgot to add some branches, then I created a new branching structure in another folder. 
  But according to the teacher's request, I submitted the original git. Maybe I can put the later branching structure here.
